## Healthcare-Cost-Optimisation
A business analytics project focused on identifying healthcare cost drivers using provider-level data. Includes end-to-end analysis: data cleaning, EDA, cost breakdowns, and actionable business recommendations.
Improving Cost Efficiency in Outpatient Specialties: A Data-Driven Approach

## Why I Built This
As someone passionate about solving real-world problems using data, I wanted to understand why healthcare costs vary across states and specialties in the U.S. This project simulates a consulting case where a firm is hired by a healthcare payer to identify cost drivers and suggest cost control strategies.

## The Business Problem
The client - a national health insurer - is concerned about rising outpatient care costs. They want a data-backed understanding of which providers or specialties are driving costs and why.

## Tools & Skills Used
- Jupyter Notebook (Python, Pandas, Seaborn)
- Data Storytelling
- Correlation Analysis
- Cost Driver Identification

## My Key Findings
- Cardiology and Oncology had the highest average cost per procedure.
- Some states (NY, IL) show high cost variance across providers, hinting at inefficiencies.
- Cost was driven more by **avg. cost per procedure** than procedure volume.

## Recommendations
- Introduce bundled pricing for high-cost specialties.
- Benchmark underperforming regions.
- Automate billing reviews for high-variance providers.

## What I Learned
This project helped me sharpen my data storytelling and business reasoning - critical for roles in business analytics and consulting.
